# Sensing the Weather - Wind Gust Speed Worksheet

In this lesson you will:

- Understand the definition of a 'gust of wind'
- Translate this definition into a format the computer can understand
- Be able to store wind speed measurements in a list for later analysis
- Be able to manipuate data items in a list

## What hardware will we use?

To measure the wind gust speed we will also use the anemometer, the same instrument we used to measure the wind speed in a previous lesson.


## Getting Started

1. Set up your Raspberry Pi and ensure you are in desktop mode.

1. Launch the terminal

    ![Terminal](images/terminal.png)

1. Move to the `weather station` directory by typing `cd weather_station` and pressing `enter`

1. Make a copy of your wind_final program to a new file called `wind_gust.py` by typing this command into the terminal and pressing enter.

	```bash
	cp wind_final.py wind_gust.py
	```
If you don't have your old program, you can download a copy of the old [wind speed program](../wind_speed/code/wind_final.py) from here into your `weather_station` folder.

1. Open the program by typing `sudo idle3 wind_gust.py`. We still need to use all of this code to gather wind speeds, but we need to add to it to be able to store and analyse the wind speeds.
    
## Storing wind speed readings

Since the time period we are interested in is 20 seconds and our existing program records wind speed every 5 seconds (this is the number of seconds stored in the `interval` variable in the program), we need to record the **four** most recent readings to cover the last 20 seconds. To do this we will use a Python data structure called a list. 

Here is some code which creates an empty list. Add this at the top of your program next to where you have initialised your other variables.

```python
store_speeds = []
```
Now we need to make sure that when we calculate a speed reading inside the function `calc_speed()`, that speed reading gets recorded in the list. Your old code for this function should look like this at the moment:

```python
def calculate_speed(time_sec):
    global count
    circumference_cm = (2 * math.pi) * radius_cm
    rotations = count / 2.0

    dist_km = (circumference_cm * rotations) / CM_IN_A_KM

    km_per_sec = dist_km / time_sec
    km_per_hour = km_per_sec * SECS_IN_AN_HOUR

    return km_per_hour * ADJUSTMENT
```
The final result for the wind speed is the final line where we `return km_per_hour * ADJUSTMENT`. Returning a value immediately ends the function, but as we want to add some other calculations we need to change this.

1. Alter the code to store the wind speed result in a variable so we can return it later.

	```python
	final_speed = km_per_hour * ADJUSTMENT
	```
1. Add the speed to our list of wind speed measurements:

	```python
	store_speeds.append(final_speed)
	```

1. We only want to store the last 4 measurements of wind speed to cover the previous 20 seconds, but if we carry on adding each new measurement to the list, we will soon have a very long list! To prevent this from happening we need to check how long the list is using the `len()` function, and if adding this item takes the list over 4 items, we want to chop off the oldest item, which will be the first item in the list. To do this, we can use the slicing operator:

	```python
	store_speeds = store_speeds[1:]
	```
	Each item in a list is called an **element**. This code tells the list to slice off a chunk of the list from element 1 to the end. It might sound like this won't do anything, unless you know that elements in lists are indexed from 0. For example, if I have the list `["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]` then element 0 is "a", element 1 is "b" etc, so using this code, element 0 in the list will be chopped off.

	Add some code to your `calculate_speed()` function to store the reading, chop the list, and then return the latest calculated speed. Here is some pseudo code to help you achieve this:

    > STORE most recent reading IN store_speeds LIST
    > 
    > IF store_speeds LIST has MORE THAN 4 elements
    >
    > --- store_speeds LIST = SLICE store_speeds LIST from element 1 to end
    >
    > RETURN final_speed
    

## Checking for gusts

### Question
A gust of wind occurs within a given time period when:
- the highest wind speed measured during that period is above 29.6km/h AND
- the difference between the peak speed and lowest speed in that period is greater than 16.7km/h AND
- the time period is 20 seconds or less

Now that we have the data available to us, how can we ask the computer to check whether a gust has occurred? Take a look at the data below which stores four wind speed readings in km/h, taken 5 seconds apart, and decide for each line of data a) if there was a gust or not, and b) if so, what is the wind gust speed?

```python
Data #1 - [1.4, 2.6, 42.9, 4.4]
Data #2 - [1.3, 17.2, 24.2, 28.8]
Data #3 - [34.9, 33.1, 35.9, 31.3]
Data #4 - [2.9, 3.8, 2.1, 6.5]
```

### Answer
A gust has occurred for Data #1, but not in the other data sets. Let's examine why. We already measured a time period of 20 seconds, but for a gust to have occurred, two further conditions need to be true:

- **Condition 1** - Highest wind speed above 29.6km/h
- **Condition 2** - Difference between highest and lowest is above 16.7km/h

So the results for each data set are:

| Data set      | Condition 1   | Condition 2   			| Gust?   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| Data #1      	| True (42.9)	| True (42.9 - 1.4 = 41.5)	| True 	  |
| Data #2      	| False (28.8) 	| True (28.8 - 1.3 = 27.5)	| False   |
| Data #3 		| True (35.9)  	| False (35.9 - 31.3 = 4.6)	| False   |
| Data #4 		| False (6.5)  	| False (6.5 - 2.1 = 4.4)	| False   |

(If you have studied Boolean logic, you might notice that these examples form the truth table for the logical operator 'AND' - for the gust to be true, both condition 1 AND condition 2 need to be true.)

## Adding a gust detection function

Now that we have a well defined logical way of testing whether a gust has occurred, our final job is to add a function we can call to check whether a gust occurred in the last 20 seconds. 

1. Create a new function called `check_for_gusts()`

1. Inside this function, create variables to store the highest and lowest speeds in the `store_speeds` list. You can calculate these easily using the built in Python functions `min()` and `max()`.

1. Now add constants to represent the values we are testing against
- `GUST_ABOVE` - a gust occurs when the wind speed is above 29.6km/h AND
- `GUST_RANGE` - a gust occurs when the range is above 16.7km/h

1. Finally, check the conditions and return either the gust speed if a gust has occurred, or 0 if no gust is recorded within this time period. 

Here is some pseudo code to help you.

	> FUNCTION check_for_gusts()
	> --- highest = MAX speed in list
	> --- lowest = MIN speed in list
	> --- IF highest > GUST_ABOVE and highest - lowest > GUST_RANGE
	> --- --- RETURN highest
	> --- ELSE
	> --- --- RETURN 0

The final code can be found [here](code/wind_gust.py).

Run and test your program. If you are testing it indoors by pushing the anemometer by hand, what issues do you think might occur which might make it difficult to test your code?

## Summary

- You have created a program which stores the last 20 seconds of wind speed data as four readings in a list, and checks whether a gust of wind has occurred. 
- How can you test whether your program works?


## What's next
- Devise a way to test your code indoors. It is unlikely that you will be able to generate "gusts" by spinning the anemometer at greater than 29.6km/h by hand. How could you test whether the code you have written to check for gusts actually works? 
- Devise a test plan and test your code
