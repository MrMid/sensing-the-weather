- Design, use, and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and
behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems
- Use two or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a
variety of computational problems
- Design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functions
- Undertake creative projects that involve selecting, using, and combining multiple
applications, preferably across a range of devices, to achieve challenging goals,
including collecting and analysing data, and meeting the needs of known users
