# Lesson 2: Using GPIO input mode

## Introduction

In this lesson students will experiment with the Raspberry Pi GPIO and do some Python programming. We are going to focus on input mode specifically since this is more appropriate to sensing things from the outside world than output mode. This knowledge will be used to interface with the rain gauge and wind speed sensors in later lessons.

## Resources

Students should work in pairs. Each pair will require the following equipment:

- Raspberry Pi
- Micro USB power adaptor
- An SD Card with Raspbian already set up through NOOBS
- USB keyboard
- USB mouse
- HDMI cable
- A monitor or TV
- Two **Male to Female** jumper wires (try [Pimoroni](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/jumper-jerky))
- Note: Install the NOOBS software before the lesson to save time
