![](../../../images/rain_guage.jpg)

## Introduction

In this lesson students will use the weather station expansion board and the rain gauge. Students will firstly learn how the rain gauge works, then Python code will be written to interface with it, detect rainfall and display the measurement value.

## Resources

Students should work in pairs. Each pair will require the following equipment:

- Raspberry Pi
- Weather Station Expansion Board
- Rain gauge
- Micro USB power adaptor
- An SD Card with Raspbian already set up through NOOBS
- USB keyboard
- USB mouse
- HDMI cable
- A monitor or TV

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how the rain gauge works
- Understand how to write code to interface with it and produce a measurement

## Starter

Firstly ask everyone to remove the lid from their rain gauge. This is done by applying some pressure to the area of the case just above where the two screw holes are on the base. Squeeze gently here and the lid should pop off.
