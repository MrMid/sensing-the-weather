## Introduction

This lesson will introduce the concept of a weather station and why we need one to build one. It serves as a general introduction to the scheme of work and will orientate the students to give them a general overview of the goals they will work towards.

## Starter

Predictions about future weather can have no credibility unless they are based on the analysis of scientifically gathered measurements. So what can we measure and how can we do it scientifically?

Firstly consider the characteristics of weather that we might want to predict in a forecast. These may include:

- Temperature (the measurement of hot and cold)
- Air pressure (the force per unit of area exerted by the air)
- Air quality (how contaminated the air is)
- Humidity (the amount of water vapor in the air)
- Rainfall (a depth per unit area of rain)
- Wind direction (the direction *from* which wind is blowing)
- Wind speed (the force exerted by the wind)
