# Lesson 6: Deploying the Weather Station

![](../../../images/weather_station.png)

## Introduction

In this lesson students will fully assemble and test the weather station indoors, they will then select an appropriate location outside and proceed to deploy it there. Students will learn how location affects each of the sensors and why choosing a good location will ensure the quality of their measurements. Once deployed the students will remotely monitor the weather station from indoors to verify that it is set up and working as expected.

## Resources

Students should work in pairs. Each pair will require the following equipment (most of this will have been supplied as port of the weather station kit itself):

- Raspberry Pi
- Weather Station Expansion Board
- Rain guage
- Anemometer
- Wind vane
- AIR sensor board (with short 6 wire RJ11 cable)
- Ground temperature probe
- Long Ethernet Cable (long enough to reach from the school building to the chosen location)
- 24 volt UK Mains Power Supply
- Passive POE splitter and injector set
- 2 x IP65/66 electrical junction box (the case to protect the electronics)
- Screws for fixing the junction boxes to another object (e.g. gate post)
- Rubber washers to prevent ingress of water via the screw holes
- 5 x IP65/66 M20 cable glands
- An SD Card with Raspbian already set up through NOOBS
- USB keyboard
- USB mouse
- HDMI cable
- A monitor or TV
