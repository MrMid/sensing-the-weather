# Lesson 4: The anemometer

![](../../../images/anemometer.png)

## Introduction

In this lesson students will use the weather station expansion board and the anemometer. Students will firstly learn how the anemometer works, then Python code will be written to interface with it, detect its rotation and calculate the wind speed using a mathematical formula.

## Resources

Students should work in pairs. Each pair will require the following equipment:

- Raspberry Pi
- Weather Station Expansion Board
- Anemometer
- Micro USB power adaptor
- An SD Card with Raspbian already set up through NOOBS
- USB keyboard
- USB mouse
- HDMI cable
- A monitor or TV
- A small phillips screwdriver

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how the anemometer works
- Understand how to write code to interface with it and calculate wind speed

## Starter

Firstly ask everyone to pull the top off their anemometer, it goes back on just as easily. This is done by holding the base in one hand and pulling on the blades/cups with the other hand. It doesn't need much force to come off.

Look at the underside of the blades/cups and you'll see a small metal cylinder on one side. This is a magnet just like the one found on the bucket of the rain gauge. Test it with a paper clip if you like.

Now use the screw driver to remove the three screws on the bottom of the base. The base should then pop out easily. Slide it down the cable about 10 to 20 cm to get it out of the way. Now if you look inside you'll see our old friend the reed switch again.

So what does this mean? When the blades/cups are in their original position and spinning the magnet will rotate in a tight circle above the reed switch. The magnet most influences the reed switch as it passes over the ends (where the gold wires come out). So for every complete rotation there will be two moments when the switch is closed.

So using a similar programming technique to the rain gauge we can count the number of interrupts and divide it by two to give us the number of complete rotations. We can then calculate the wind speed with some maths using Ï€.

Reassemble the anemometer, put the base back into position and ensure the knot in the cable remains inside. Replace the three screws and push the blades/cups back onto the top. Give it a spin to check it rotates correctly.
