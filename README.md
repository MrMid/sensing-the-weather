# Sensing the Weather

![](cover.png)

This scheme of work introduces students to Raspberry Pi Weather Station, a project which aims to get schoolchildren building and programming their own weather station to collect and present data. This is the first of a series of activities which introduces some simple sensors and gets the students writing Python code to gather data from them.
