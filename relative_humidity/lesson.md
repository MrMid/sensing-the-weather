#  Sensing the Weather - Relative Humidity Lesson

In this lesson students will learn how to take readings from the relative humidity and ambient temperature sensor and use this data to find the dew point of the current environment.

## Sensor Guide

Background information about the [relative humidity sensor](about.md)

## Learning objectives

- Be able to take temperature and relative humidity readings from the relative humidity sensor
- Be able to write code to solve a given equation for a chosen variable
- Be able to look up values in a dictionary and return a corresponding statement

## Cross-Curricular applications

- Computer Science - functions, dictionaries
- Geography - climate, humidity, heat index, saturation, water vapour
- Mathematics - solving equation for dew point

## Lesson Summary

- What is relative humidity?
- What is the dew point?
- Use readings of relative humidity and temperature to calculate the dew point 
- Look up this value using a dictionary and provide some advice about how this will feel to humans

## Starter

Discuss the concepts of relative humidity and the dew point, using the information from the [further information about the sensor](about.md). Before beginning the main part of the task students should understand what they are trying to achieve with this program - they will calculate the dewpoint from the humidity and temperature values, and then use this to display a statement about how this will feel to humans, read from a dictionary.

## Main development

1. Students boot their Raspberry Pi weather station with the air module attached

1.
