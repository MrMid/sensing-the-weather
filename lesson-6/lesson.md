#  Weather Station - Data Collection Lesson Plan 6 - Deploying the Weather Station

In this lesson students will fully assemble and test the weather station indoors, they will then select an appropriate location outside and proceed to deploy it there. Students will learn how location affects each of the sensors and why choosing a good location will ensure the quality of their measurements. Once deployed the students will remotely monitor the weather station from indoors to verify that it is set up and working as expected.
