#  Sensing the Weather - Wind Direction Lesson

In this lesson students will learn how a more complicated sensor called a wind vane works. They will collect readings from the wind vane to determine the direction from which the wind is blowing.

## Sensor Guide

Background information about the [wind vane](about.md)

## Learning objectives

- Understand how the wind vane uses reed switches to change its output voltage
- Understand the difference between an analogue and a digital signal
- Be able to write a program to output the wind direction based on input from the wind vane

## Cross-Curricular applications

- Computer Science - instantiating objects, object methods
- Geography - wind direction for meteorological forecasts
- Mathematics - degrees, bearings
- Physics - resistance, circuits, analogue vs digital

## Lesson Summary

- Examine the wind vane and discuss its purpose, how it works and its units of measurement
- Review understanding of 360 degree angles
- Discuss the concept of an object in a program
- Students code and test their wind direction program

## Starter

Examine the [wind vane](about.md) and discuss with pupils how it measures the wind direction. It is a much more complicated sensor than the rain gauge and anemometer sensors, still using reed switches but combining eight of these with variable resistors to alter the voltage output according to the position of the internal magnet. 

Recap the points of the compass and how these relate to bearings in degrees (a revision article on bearings can be found on [BBC Bitesize](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/maths/geometry/coordinatesandbearingsrev3.shtml)). 

## Main development

1. Set up the Raspberry Pi weather station and connect the wind vane. Turn the weather station on and log in.

1. The code we are going to write relies on a **class** (another piece of code) which was written as part of the Raspberry Pi weather station software you installed during the installation process. Therefore, it is important that the wind direction program is saved within the `weather_station` folder on the Raspberry Pi so that it can access this code, otherwise it will not work.

1. We need to use the pre-written code because ...
